# loan-prediction

This is a data science project that made use of a dataset containing information about loans and its applicants and whether the loan was approved or not. After the data cleaning process, the tidy data was saved to a PostgreSQL database using the AWS RDS. In this project, I have made use of tools like Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy and sklearn), Jupyter notebooks, statistical inference, machine learning and classification algorithms, data cleaning, git and github pages. The full report can be accessed [here](https://mateusmelo821.github.io/loan-prediction/).
